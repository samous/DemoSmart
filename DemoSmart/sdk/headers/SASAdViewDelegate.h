 The delegate of a SASAdView object must adopt the SASAdViewDelegate protocol.
 
 Many methods of SASAdViewDelegate return the ad view sent by the message.
 The protocol methods allow the delegate to be aware of the ad-related events.
 You can use it to handle your app's or the ad's behavior like adapting your viewController's view size depending on the ad being displayed or not.
