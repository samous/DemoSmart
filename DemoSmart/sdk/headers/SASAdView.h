/** The SASAdView class provides a wrapper view that displays advertisements to the user.
 
 When the user taps a SASAdView instance, the view triggers an action programmed into the advertisement.
 For example, an advertisement might present a modal advertisement, show a video, or launch a third party application (Safari, the App Store, YouTube...).
 Your application is notified by the SASAdViewDelegate protocol methods which are called during the ad's lifecycle.
 You can interact with the view by:
 
 - refreshing it : refresh
 - displaying a local SmartAdServerAd created by your application: displayThisAd:
 - removing it : dismiss
 
 
 The delegate of a SASAdView object must adopt the SASAdViewDelegate protocol.
 The protocol methods allow the delegate to be aware of the ad-related events.
 You can use it to handle your app's or the ad's (the SASAdView instance) behavior like adapting your UIViewController's view size depending on the ad being displayed or not.
